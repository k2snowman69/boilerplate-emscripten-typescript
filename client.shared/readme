One time install
 - For all
   - mingw32 - http://mingw.org/
 - For js builds
   - Visual Studio 2017 - If building for web, you will need to install Visual Studio 2017 or greater. This is because emsdk seems to require it for some reason.
   - Emscripten - http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html
